# Diamonds Values 💎
The repository contains a website designed to evaluate the price of a diamond based on specific criteria, including the diamond's color, cut, clarity, total depth percentage, table percentage, depth, width, and length. For this project, we used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to estimate diamond prices. Additionally, we employed the KNN method to clean the database, addressing missing and incorrect values. With the cleaned database, we also use the method KNN to predict the value of new diamond.
